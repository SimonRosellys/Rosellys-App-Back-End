       1 | American Dream                      | Not too much longer til i'll take you away, not too much longer til we're ready to play, only 9 more months left til we're leaving the ground to find our feet in our American dream CHORUS Gonna travel on the open road in a tired out old bay, Gonna travel on the open road, Carolina to LA, Let the rhythm of the music lead us day after day when we find our feet in our American dream Not too much longer til we're singing our songs, not too much longer til we're jamming where we belong, only 9 more months left til we're setting far off to find our feet in our American dream CHORUS x 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
       2 | Our Song                            | She sang his song, his heart was gone already, she didn't know it, but he'd fallen. The stage was empty, and it was late, he came on over, just to say (Chorus) What's happening here, I'm falling through, I'm so tired but I cannot sleep, I am falling, through He played her song, her heart was gone already, he didn't notice, but she'd fallen. They stayed up late that night, thinking, what is this, how can it feel so real after just one kiss, what is this? (Chorus) What's happening here, I'm falling through, I'm so tired but I cannot sleep, I am falling into you, wake me up and come with me,What's happening here, (falling into you) I'm falling through, (tired but I cannot sleep),  I'm so tired but I cannot sleep,( falling into you) I am falling, through, with you They sang their song, their hearts were gone already, they didn't show it, but they'd fallen, they'd fallen.                                                                                                                                                                     |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys |

       4 | Night + Day                         | Speak, I want to speak, I'm not complete, without your love. Be, want you to be, right next to me, everyday (Chorus) And if you smile I'll smile I'll be there for you everyday, and if you cry I'll cry I'll make you happy, anyway, and if you want to hold me, night and day, Free, you make me feel free, inside of me, I'm ready to love (Chorus) (Bridge) And when you're calling my name, it's so hard to explain, you want me tell me again and again and again (Chorus) x2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | G        |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
       5 | Hand on Hand                        | She asks for me, speaks quietly, she's tired of thinking, all of the time. Can't sleep can't wake, not sure which lifeline to take, she stands in silence, sees only the ground. (Chorus) Listen closely, be sure of your mind, hear my words dear, don't find yourself crying, feel my hand here, on top of your hand, it's alright, I promise everything's fine. She pushes through the crowd, feels like falling down, unsteady, not ready, for taking hold of your hand. (Chorus) (Bridge) Take a good look at the World around. So many passers by, waiting to talk to you, it's not so easy when your feet don't touch the ground. (Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
       6 | Only Way She Knows                  | See that girl, wait for nothing, going down the only path she knows, all alone, see her move see her dancing, moving round the only way she knows, all alone, see her as she's walking down the road. See that boy going nowhere, waiting for the girl he's always known, girl he knows. See his move, come to nothing, fallen for the girl who holds her own, all alone, see her as she's walking down the road. (Chorus) Independent lady, feels like going crazy, talks to no one but she feels alright tonight. Independent lady, feels like going crazy, talks to no one as she's walking along, down the road.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
       7 | Wipe Your Fears                     | You came home late. Happened day after day. Been sleeping alone. Wait for you to come home. (Chorus) I wiped your tears, your tears and your fears. I cleaned your face, your face and your shame. I held your eyes, and your lies, to mine. She came by our house. Thought I'd never find out. Why do you play all those games. Just yourself left to blame. (Chorus) (Bridge) All those years, we spent together. All those nights, have vanished before my eyes. Now our time, is nearly over. I'm calm and I'm ready to say... (Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
       8 | Reasons For Everything              | Big outdoor spaces, and, heavy water crashing on the sand. A bay laughing, and, someone special holding onto your hand. (Chorus)  Teach me, love me, show me ways to understand. See me, completely, question my reasons for everything. A new guitar, and, reading books that open up your mind. Those far off stars, and, the perfect gift that took ages for you to find. (Chorus) (Bridge) Suddenly I'm inspired by things I see. No use hiding behind naivety. Suddenly I'm inspired by things I read. Take your time and set yourself free. (Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
       9 | Big Brown Coat                      | Driving through the town, stuck in traffic all around. Gonna make me late, no time for a coffee break. Hear my favourite song, feel so excited, cos all I can think of is you. Big queue at the bank, shuts in ten will have to come back. Walking to the train, turning cloudy starts to rain. Looking up at the sky, feel so excited, cos all I can think of is you.(Chorus)All I can think of is you, all I can think of is you. Nothing feels bad and I'm never blue with you.Tore my favourite dress, got it caught but I couldn't care less. Lost a twenty pound note, from the pocket of my big brown coat. Nothing makes me cry, cos I know that you love me and all I can think of is you.(Chorus)(Bridge)My mind's distracted, my mind is full of you, my body's aching, cos all I think of is you. My life's distracted, my life is full of you, my body's aching, cos all I think of is..(Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                       |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      10 | Darker Side of Me                   | You call me up, late last night. Ask me how I'm feeling if I'm feeling alright. Don't give up, don't give up the fight, to the darker side of me. I called you up, the very next day. Told you how I'm feeling, not been feeling okay. Help me up, cos I'm on my way, to the darker side of me. (Chorus) Can't get it out, this feeling inside. I'm going crazy and I don't know why. I'm losing hold of my reality, to the darker side of me. I called you up, been feeling down. Going round in circles in this crazy town. Help me up, cos I'm on my down, to the darker side of me.    (Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      11 | Rescue Me                           | Walking down a one way street, nothing left behind, to keep me waiting, and keep me sane. But who will come here and rescue me? Somewhere far and somewhere cold, lost inside my mind, I'm suffocating, and all alone. But who will come here, and who will understand just who I am, just who I am. Walking down a one way street, nothing left behind, to keep me waiting, and keep me sane. But who will come here, and who will understand just who I am, just who I am. And who will come here, and rescue me?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      25 | Too Much Wine                       | Too much wine makes we weary, it knocks me off my feet. And when I'm down feeling lonely, these tears they come so fast. (Chorus) Are you in love, are you in love, are you in love, with a girl, like me. Don't ask for much when it's early, I'm a girl who needs her sleep. And when it's time to feel pretty, I spend no time on pretty things. (Chorus) Are you in love, are you in love, are you in love love love love are you in love love love love, are you in love with a girl like me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      12 | Home With You                       | Feeling high when I feel low, always warm when I feel cold. You walk ahead when I'm, walking slowly. You're always late when I'm on time, have to guess what's on my mind. Only 2 steps behind, but it feels alright. (Chorus) And who knows, whether it's wrong, and who cares, when I feel like I'm at home, when I'm with you. And I don't belong, when you're gone, I don't belong, when you're gone. Who knows whether it's wrong, and who knows whether it's right, and who cares, when I feel like I'm at home, when I'm with you. And I don't belong, when you're gone, I don't belong when you're gone, I don't belong...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      13 | Wake Me Up                          | Wake me up when I'm fast asleep, where are you, waiting for me in my dream. Keep me me guessing when I won't believe, see you there, see you when I fall asleep. And I'll wait for you, and I'll cry for you, and I'll wait for you. Its been too long since you've felt me close, pulled me near, held me like you won't let go. Keep on thinking about the night's we've lost, where are you, waiting for me in my dream. And I'll wait for you, this time. And I'll cry for you, each night. And I'll wait for you..    (and I'll cry and I'll cry...for when I'm gonna see you again)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      14 | Caught Me At A Bad Time             | (Chorus) Caught me at a bad time, caught me at a bad time last night. Found my troubles down town, found my troubles down town, cos I feel like moving on, cos I feel like moving on. As the sun went down, the night it came so fast. Drinking steadily, sipping til I couldn't see, all my troubles ahead. (Chorus) As I stumbled along, I lost my sense of pride. Found a lonely soul, asked him if he'd take me home, and keep me warm through the night. Heading home tomorrow, heading home tomorrow first light. Gonna take the long road, gonna take the long road, cos it's clear I don't belong, cos it's clear I don't belong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      15 | Mr Man                              | Hey Mr Man, tell me your name. How many times, do I have to tell you again. Hey Mr Man, sitting alone. Keep wasting your time, should find someone to help you move on. Hey Mr Man, waiting for me. Why do you stay, you know that I will turn you away.(Chorus)You're not my kind dear, I've made it so clear. Don't make this harder than it is, I'm never going to steal you a kiss.Hey Mr Man, tell me your name. How may times, do I have to tell you again.(Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      16 | The Moon and The Stars              | Take my hand, take me anywhere and show me lift, through your eyes. (Chorus) Saw the moon and the stars in the sky that night, felt the cold summer breeze on our cheeks. Nothing near nothing far except the light of the stars, shining down.Hold me near, hold my body near, and don't let go, til I tell you so. (Chorus) Saw the moon and the stars in the sky, felt the cold summer breeze on our cheeks. Nothing near nothing far except the light of the stars, shining down, shining down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys |

I won't be here to see you when you're grown, but I'll always love you, when the sun's going down. A mother lay weary, as she settled for night. Her children sat near, as she found the other side. She wouldn't be there, to hold them all the time, but there's always love there, when the sun's going down. I know you are waiting to see me again, and though you are gone, we are nowhere near the end. Just a matter of time til I see you my friend, cos there's always love there, when the sun's going down.

      18 | You Stole My Heart                  | You make me weak in the knees boy, you makes me feel like losing myself. And when I start to cry, you are always by my side, anytime, you're by my side.You make me feel so at ease boy, you make me feel like wasting no time.

(Chorus) Walk the long road to the Redwoods in the sky. There I'll meet you by the fire you and I. Fall asleep amongst the shadows of the trees, so free, so free.

      20 | I Want to Drive                     | (Chorus) I won't be a passenger, I want to drive. I won't take second best, in my own life. I want to drive, I wanna drive. I want to drive, I wanna drive. Long dark road no lights, cars too close, trying to take your life. Sun sets low on the hills, shadows glow, from the mountains. (Chorus) Crash on the side of the road, people stare, instead of looking ahead. Listen to the song in your head, keeping you there, until you make it. (Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |          | G                 | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      21 | No More Dark Days                   | Sun comes out the Winter's gone, turn the hands of time by one, no more dark days to bring us down. Glass of wine in the evening breeze, stay up late with company, no more dark days to bring us down.(Chorus)No more dark days to bring us down, dark days to bring us down, dark days to bring, us down.Feel the heat of the healing sun, making it better when it all goes wrong, no more dark days to bring us down.Trees full of colours you never knew, could be so vibrant and beautiful, no more dark days to bring us down.(Chorus) repeat (bring us down)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |          | FIDDLE            | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      22 | Lover's Game                        | You and me, we'll make it through. Lovers first, then friendship too. If you don't ask questions you'll never know. The truth can hurt but it helps you grow. We all change, some for good. What we want, misunderstood. If you don't ask questions you'll never know. The truth can hurt but it helps you grow. (Chorus) We're two small pieces in a lover's game. Let me lose and I'll win the same. Two small pieces in a lover's game. Life moves on, can make you sad. But I see you, see what we have. If you don't ask questions you'll never know. The truth can hurt but it helps you grow.

      23 | Heartaches and Promises             | Don't answer my phone calls I'm wondering why, two beers and a girl and your head it turned. I went from warm to the coldest I've been, felt worn and unclean that's what you did. (Chorus) Heartaches and promises, means nothing to me, you've taken everything, but the best of me. I lost my senses believed your words, got carried away in your fantasy. You played me right like a gambling hand, just another round to talk about. (Chorus) (Bridge) Used, like a second hand care. Broken and pushed too far. (Chorus) x3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      24 | Angel At The Door                   | There's a girl I saw, an angel at the door. Not quite the same as I'd ever seen before. Her face lit up, like something from above. I knew right there and then, this one was my love. (Chorus) This diamond may be rough, this diamond won't give up. All I know is this time it's for real. Some folks say, he's not good enough. I'm here to stay, I don't care that much, for what they say. We'll take our time, there's no need to rush. I knew right there and then, this one was my love. (Chorus) repeat.

Twist and turn til you're feeling the burn. Don't go, don't go. (Chorus) Don't say you're tired, it's just a state of mind, enjoy yourself and don't go. Don't go, stay for the night.

      27 | Keep On Smiling (Zoe's Song)        | You're feeling weary, your day is long. You're learning the way things should sound and should feel under your touch. You're not even one, already so fair. You're charming the people around with your smiles and your new funny ways. (Chorus) Keep on smiling, it's the best thing to do. A smile goes a long way and keeps you from trouble and helps you through. Childhood goes slowly, the rest goes so fast. Don't grow up too quickly enjoy all the fun that childhood brings. 'Cos times get harder, just the way it is. Know your family love you they'll help you with anything hard that you face.(Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys |

We're here in the still of the night. Whenever you cry we will hold you, remember you are never, alone. Sleeping tight, through the night, our dream. How you've grown, moving on, so sweet.

      29 | Cover Them Up                       | She was eighteen, but it was hard to believe. She wore the dark lines, where she struggled to sleep. She cut so deep so she couldn't feel, she had the arms of a child but the scars like I'd never seen. (Chorus) We'll wash them down and cover them up. We'll help her next time when the next time comes. She had a hard life, like I'd never known. They'd keep a watch out, try not to leave her alone. But when their head was turned, she cut so deep so she couldn't feel, she had the arms of child but the scars like I'd never seen.(Chorus) x2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      30 | Still Too Young                     | I'm a little bit scare, of living on the straight and narrow path. Having children and making money to make it last, 'cos I'm still too young. I'm nearly hitting thirty, my friends are all married and they're buying up their property. They're saving for their future when they're older when they're elderly, but I'm still too young. (Chorus) Just keep singing and playing that's all I know. Don't think further than tomorrow. I'm not the same, as the nine 'til five hard workers the next day, is the same as the one before and the one to come, 'cos I'm still too young. I want a little bit more, the nights to count and the memories to show. Live fast don't think further than tomorrow, 'cos I'm still too young.(Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      31 | Queensland Sky                      | Sailed so long on foreign shores, men put down hard work no love. Set them free they'll make their home sweet home. Captain frowned their spirits low, thrown him off and burnt their boat. Now they're free they'll make their home sweet home. (Chorus) As the sun beat down from the Queensland Sky, was spared no shade from the other side, skin so burnt skin so dry, they'd bury themselves in the sand. One year gone on foreign land settled down with wife and child, now they're safe they'll make their home sweet home. News got back to the English throne, of mutineers on foreign shores. Sent a boat to bring them home sweet home. (Chorus) One year long Pandora sailed. Found the enemy locked them in. Now Pandora's box was home sweet home. Made a turn and hit the reef. Some men drowned, some set free. Swam their way to shore and waited still. (Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                | D        | FIDDLE, ACCORDIAN | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      32 | Camden Town                         | Lots to do in Camden town I'll meet you off the underground, work our way through the crowds and buy ourselves some boots. Spend the day looking round, find then cheap second hand, have a drink and settle down and watch the World go by. (Chorus) In Camden Town anything goes, can be yourself there's no one to judge, in Camden Town. Army coats and coloured hair, piercings where you wouldn't dare, ink across the skin so bear, tells a tale or two. Girls with girls holding hands, music from a great live band, eat dinner from the Chinese stand, a night we won't forget.

      33 | Dark Clouds or Blue Skies           | In the morning when it rains and the day starts again, dark clouds cover up the sun. Blues skies are gone it's a struggle to carry on, know the worries that you share you won't become. (Chorus) Dark clouds or blue skies, life will carry on. Rainfall or sunshine, life will carry on. Dark clouds or blue skies, life will carry on, and the worries that you share you won't become. In the evening when it's late, you're lying in your bed, wide awake sleep won't come. Thoughts of things you haven't done, won't leave you alone, know the worries that you share you won't become. (chorus) When the money is running low, it's a struggle to pay the bills, selling everything you own. Every penny you ever spend, dark thoughts in your head, know the worries that you share you won't become.

      34 | On The Porch                        | On the porch, with my friends, I wouldn't change a thing. Got my bamjo, got my fiddle, I've got some songs to sing. (Chorus) On the porch in San Antone (x3) My second home Cold beer, friends near, serenading. Old songs, new songs, I wouldn't change a thing. (Chorus) Keep The Light (35) Can't feel the heat, it's dark and cold. You think the fire's gone out but keep the light. Can't catch your breath, the air's too thin. You think the fire's gone out but keep the light. (Chorus) You think the fire's gone out and you're all to blame, but you can keep it burning if you keep the light. You run out of fuel, it won't ignite. You think the fire's gone out but keep the light.

And now that your old and your hair is silver grey, I'll look after you the same way. When I was a young girl you taught me to read, showed me the joy of a book. And now that you're old and your mind is not your own, I'll read you the words you used to know. Silver grey, mind's not your own, silver grey, but you're not alone. When I was a teenager full of rage, you'd calm me down with your words. And now that you're old and frustration comes through, I'll bring the calm to you. When I was a mother with a baby too, you loved him like he was your own. But now that you're old and you don't know who I am, I'll love you the best that I can. Frustration comes, don't know who I am, frustration comes, but you're not alone, silver grey, mind's not your own, sliver grey, but you're not alone.                                                                                                                                                                                     |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      36 | Stone That Never Rolls              | When the light has gone and the dark has come, don't believe it'll stay. Things will change again like the blowing of the wind, and I'll be the stone that never rolls. When the fire's out and it's cold as ice, don't give up on life. Things will move along with the turning of the sun, and I'll be the stone that never rolls. Like a wall around that you can't break down, don't believe it'll last. Things will settle down, good will come around, and I'll be the stone that never rolls.

It's your story, and it's gonna be read out loud. (Chorus) Pain and it's pressing down on my chest. It's a heartache and it's a feeling that i'll never forget, never forget. Road rage, something that they'll never forgive, but it's too late, just flowers on the side of the lane. It's your story, and it's gonna be read out loud. (Chorus) Early mornings, it's the lonely time of the day. I hear you calling, but you'll never lay beside me again. It's your story, and it's gonna be read out loud.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      38 | You Can't Pin Me Down               | You can't pin me down, movings in my blood, and I was born to those with music in their hands. I spent my first four years, in Germany. Was made there but I'm an English girl. (Chorus) Keep trying but I can't keep still. I'm a small tree with no roots in soil. You can't pin me down, it doesn't suit my style. I'll stay a while and then I'm moving on. When you lose someone, it teaches many things. The gift of life, the gift of time. (Chorus) You can't pin me down, I wouldn't get nowhere. I'm a slow train creeping through the night. You can't pin me down, it doesn't suit my style. I'll stay a while and then I'm flying out.

(Chorus) (You) ain't gotta go home but you can't stay here. X3 Can't stay here Your troubles from the day have faded far away, whisky warms your throat and numbs your blues. Band keeps playing loud feet don't touch the ground. Dancing with a stranger feels so good, one more round to keep your spirits high.

I'll keep my distance when you need me to when you're feeling trapped like a pet in the zoo and I won't say I told you so even when it's true, I'm your firefly light in the night. (Chorus) Firefly light in the night, when it's dark I'll guide you I'll be shining bright, and I'll keep on glowing never out of sight, I'm your firefly light in the night. I'll hold your hand when we're 93 when your mind stops working and your eyes don't see and we'll look back smiling at our family, I'm your firefly light in the night. I'll make you laugh when you're feeling low and I'll keep us warm when the weather's cold, if you weren't here I'd be serving life without parole, I'm your firefly light in the night. (Chorus) x2                                                                                                                                         | E        |                   | Rebecca Rosellys |

But things have changed in some ways harder, I'm not the young girl you first knew. (Chorus) Don't pull away from me, tell me what you're going through, see me when I look at you, don't pull away. X2 Spend every day with each other, but talking real words gets harder to do. Know that I love you although I hurt you, when I don't find the right words to say. (Chorus) Too much to lose I can't imagine, what would happen if we were to end. It makes me cry to know what's happening, don't be the person that gave up and went. (Bridge) Just think back to what we have and what we'd lose. This is you, this is me, don't give up. See the truth, what is real, don't give up.

      42 | Falling In Love Isn't So Hard       | Wrap you in my jumper when you're feeling cold (make you feel better when you're feeling old). Drive you to work on a rainy day (make you your dinner when you come home late). Wrap you in my jumper when you're feeling cold, and I wanted to tell you.. (Chorus) Falling in love isn't so hard, you had me right, right from the start. Falling in love isn't so hard. Talk all night when you're feeling blue (you're all I think of when I'm not with you). Rub your back send you to sleep (play you a song something by GP). Talk all night when you're feeling blue, and I wanted to tell you.. (Chorus 2) Falling in love isn't so hard, you had me right, right from the start. Falling in love and staying that way, that's when it's harder and easy to fake. Falling in love isn't so hard. Pour you a drink in your favourite cup (stop you drinking when you've had too much). Saying nothing when I know you're wrong (making it better when I know I'm wrong). Pour you a drink in your favourite cup, and I wanted to tell you.. (Chorus 2)                       |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      43 | A Love Song To You Mother           | There's nothing like a mother when you're feeling down, to tell you what you're needing to hear. There's nothing like a mother when your luck runs out, to help you every step of the way. (Chorus) Words can't express what you mean to me, it's a love song to you mother you mean everything. Listen to the words like you listen to me, it's a love song to you mother you mean everything. There's beauty on the inside just ask your friends, there's no one that you wouldn't help. There's beauty on the outside that you doubt yourself, age is number not a rule. (Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys |

They're the next generation to learn the Cajun ways. (Chorus) Lafayette, Louisiana family and food, good music and laughter. Lafayette, Louisiana like coming home. A bar on the Bayou, music all night long. There's three generations singing them Cajun songs. Everyone dancing, forget the heat. Accordion playing keeping that Cajun beat.(Chorus) x3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | A        | FIDDLE, ACCORDIAN | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      45 | Hands Down (Electrified By You)     | From your head to your toes, perfection doesn't even come close. Getting lost in your eyes, the colour of an ocean tide. I've won hands down I'm electrified by you. Don't need to speak or say a word, your body does the talking first. Kiss your lips makes me smile, sends a shiver right down my spine. I've won hands down I'm electrified by you. (Chorus) I've won hands down money couldn't buy this things are looking up, nothing can divide us, I've won hands down and I'm electrified by you. You put a spell over me can't explain the way you make me feel. Lose my head lose my mind, just to have you for a little while. I've won hands down I'm electrified by you (Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      46 | Ten Years Gone                      | Don't take me back to Monday blues to Friday jams and five day weeks. Where no one care what lies below the other side, the cracks, the heat. Pay the bills and settle down, a clean white shirt that won't stand out. Don't take me back to fitting in a week of fun in two days gone. Where other people's worries spread, the burden shifts, they've lost, you've gained. Easy way is nothing new, the friends the job the house the same. Sitting in and making do, before they know it's ten years gone. Don't take me back to where I'm from where old folks fear the children on the bus. Where things are said but never done, they're getting worse, there's riots on the streets. No regrets 'til thinking through 'bout where they've been and what they've not done. Pay the bills and settle down, a clean white shirt that won't stand out. Don't take me back to be the same, to say the words but never do.                                                                                                                                                         |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      47 | Broken Dreams                       | Broken dreams when his Daddy was gone, lost all hope put his hands on a gun. And I can find many reasons to cry cos who will save my only boy. Another lover, another son, following orders 'til the day that they're done. And I can find many reasons to cry 'cos who will save my only boy. To fight, a gun and a knife. To fall down knowing that you'll never get up. The pain of clearing the blood stains, to the next best thing to a brother you had.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      48 | Mystery Friend                      | Mystery friend where are you? It's a cold time of year and I'm wanting to meet you. It's a hard time, being alone with no friends to call my own. Mystery man where are you? It's late in the night and I'm wanting to hold you. See me waiting alone, for a man to call my own. Mystery child where are you? It's late in the day and I'm wanting to see you. See me waiting alone, for a child to call my own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      49 | Save My Broken Heart                | Bad week bad month bad year, down on our luck things look bleak and it's hard to remember how it feels to be happy. It's not like us and it's not like me, normally the cup's half full. It's empty and I'm struggling to see through. (Chorus) This band is gonna save my heart, this old band is gonna mend my heart. The band is gonna save my heart my broken heart. Feels like I've failed now too many times, like I'm no way good enough. Like there's something wrong with me or there's something wrong with us. Sometimes it's hard to help myself when I've fallen down and it's hard to pick you up, when you're struggling too. (Chorus) I don't wanna pick up the phone or see my friends, like no one knows how it feels to lose so much. The truth is I know we all are the same we all suffer loss, and there's always hope when the music starts. (Chorus) (Bridge) I know times are rough when, I don't wanna play. When singing a song feels like I'm swimming in mud.(Chorus) x2                                                                               |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      50 | You're Not Alone                    | I'll love you through the good and the bad times. I'll love you when it rains and pours. (Chorus) I'll save you when you feel alone like in a cave, and no one's down there. You're not alone. I'll love you when you're struggling to wake up. I'll love you when you cannot sleep. (Chorus) I'll love you when you make it through the work day. I'll love you when you fake your smile. (Chorus) (Bridge) Don't let the World drag you down. Feel the love all around. Don't let the World drag you down. There's someone down there, you're not alone. (Chorus) Someone's down there, you're not alone. I'll be down there, you're not alone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      51 | We Should Know Better               | I should know better after all of these years. I know what makes you tick, I know how to hurt you. You should know better after all of these years. You know what makes me cry and you know how to fix it. (Chorus) Love me, don't get stuck with me. Believe in who we are. I should let go of all the small things, that don't mean a lot in the greater scheme. I don't want to let go of our memories. I'm still the same girl when you wanted me. (Chorus 2) Believe in what we have. We should know better after all of these years. I don't want to lose you, no I don't want to lose you.

      52 | Moving Forward                      | Worked hard all day, home two hours late. I'm too tired to head on out. I'm missing out on life, with all its heartaches and strife, play hard work harder, it's not right. (Chorus) I'm moving forward I'm moving on. I'm making changes to make me strong. I'm moving forward I'm moving on. 'Cos life's too short to get it wrong. I've built a ten foot wall between my heart and soul, so no one can get too close. It's time for a change, to be a person again. I want to run the risk of love.

      53 | Memories Of You And Me              | Looking down from a better place. There's no more tears and no more pain. Holding on to the memories of you and me. Keep in mind the things you said and done. Said don't be scared, and don't be wasting your time worrying about me. We had our ups, we had our downs, and times are harder now you're not around. But time moves on, so do we, and time can heal. Keep in mind the things you said and done. Said don't be scared, and don't be wasting your time worrying about me, wasting your time worrying about me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      54 | Rose Tinted Glasses                 | I gave you money you took it all. Your friends weren't my friends they never were. I'd play some songs but you never cared, and I still don't know your story well. Four long years I made it through. I learnt to drink hard I learnt from you. I'd play my heart out but you never cared, and I still don't know your story well. (Chorus) It takes more than rose tinted glasses to remember you with a smile. You're a page I've read too many times, and I still don't know your stories well. I'm a peaceful man with a gentle soul but when it comes to loving you I lose control. You wind me up like nobody else, and I still don't know your story well. (Chorus) x2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      55 | Number One                          | Made it early to sleep, work up restless half past three. Lay there thinking of you, how I'm not ready to see it through. (Chorus) I see you at my door and I know you're wanting more. I won't be free to love, 'til I love number one. Choosing something to wear, I throw some clothes on without a care. The way you're looking at me, I don't feel special I'm unhappy. (Chorus) Choosing something to eat, I took two mouthfuls was ready to leave. I know you're trying so hard, I don't feel ready to get that far.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      56 | Red, White and Blue                 | Why don't you sing about your Country they say, why don't you write about your old fashioned way. Your own true land has been forsaken for a grass that's always greener (why don't you sing they say). Why do you sing about our red, white and blue. That union jack don't mean nothing to you. I'd trade this land of hope and glory for a star spangled banner. (Why don't you sing they say). (Chorus) I want my sweet home Alabama, and Louisiana too. I want my sweet home Alabama, and my Texas too. These streets of grey might show you where I was born, but to the black tops of Texas I belong. I'd trade this land of hope and glory for a star spangled banner. (Why don't you sing they say). (Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |          | FIDDLE            | Simon Rosellys   | 
      57 | James' Song                         | I don't know how it started, but I know, it got you in the end. I can't work out your motives, but I know, I won't see you again. Found the third end to your candle and you burnt, you burnt that one too. (Chorus) 'Cos you were only a phone call away, you were only a phone call away. I told you this would happen, but you knew, this always was the plan. You didn't have to listen 'cos you knew, you're not that kind of man.

      58 | Made A Choice                       | I'm on a train going nowhere, got no chance of turning around. I'm on a train and its got no windows or doors. Stuck on a win so they tell me, can buy anything I choose. Except the time and freedom to live where I want. (Chorus) Made a choice when I was eighteen didn't know what it means, what I would become. Dealing in life, when it ends, need an armour made of steel. I'm made of flesh and blood and my skin is thin. Buried in books, it's not real, but the truth is hard to face. I've gone the long way round and I'm ready to break.

Settled in the valley made a home, with a soldier's wage, built ourselves a cabin on the creek, we were happy then. (Chorus) It's just me and you, were three but now we're two, and I will save us. But now we run, now we run. Your daddy was a good man strong and kind, a Christian soul. Provided for the family, kept us warm, would make him proud.

You're so far away, but you're close enough I feel you pulling me, I'm on my way home. (Chorus) And I'll see you in a thousand miles, driving all through the night. Got a picture of you keeps turning, turning in my head. I can't stay here, there's nothing I belong to and I know you're waiting for me.

      62 | Eva's Song                          | It seems I know your face, though I've only heard your voice. Honest and true and once in a lifetime. The years have passed on by, but your face is frozen in time. The songs that you played, live on anyway. (Chorus) And I see you, standing in the back of the bar when I sing, you keep me going. And I see you, standing in the back of the stage, when I play, I'm playing for you. Sometimes I wonder why but no one can answer me true. When there's nothing to say, the best thing is listen.

'Cos who knows the point of it anyway.Tell me who knows, what's the point of a working life, you're sweating hard from nine 'til five, and getting paid just enough to survive. Tell me who knows, what's the point of a working life. You give them forty years, they hardly notice when your desk is cleared. Tell me who knows what's the point of a working life.

Repeat verses (Chorus) x2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      68 | Bandera Saloon                      | There was a biker, his hands were pretty big. Played tears from heaven better than any man I'd seen, he played a nice tune. There was a waitress, working all night through. A long haired lover and a baby coming soon, she's working real hard. (Chorus)  find myself, in a Hill Country bar. With some strangers, strumming on an old guitar. Live ten thousand miles away, but I'm already home. There were two young boys, making big plans. Came from New Jersey selling coffee from the bank, they were the new boys. There was a cowboy, singing country tunes. Made all his money from the people passing through, he was a rich man. (Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      69 | Taste The Weekend                   | I can still taste the weekend, working late and the clock's slowing down. Will this day end, I'm so damn tired, do it all again tomorrow. All these people I know, a friendly face, but it's all for the show. When I get home, won't be too soon, won't think about tomorrow. (Chorus) If I could start again I'd be the one who never frets. If you could come with me, I'd be exactly where I want to be. Repeat verses+ chorus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      70 | Man Of Money                        | Wears his Sunday best, lights another cigarette. Its been a long short week in front of the TV. He counts his pennies and his pounds. Takes a bus ride out, to a bar with some music and a friendly crowd. (Chorus) A man of money, but he's living on the rough side now. From nothing to a millionaire he was given it the wrong way round. The band's in full swing, but he's had his last drink, and it's a long way back, hails the bus like a black cab. When he gets on home, he's feeling hungry and alone, but his fridge is empty and his bed is cold. (Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      71 | Cocaine Train                       | I met my friend Charlie on the wrong side of the tracks. Gave him all my money didn't think I'd get it back. Took me to a place that I have never been before. The trouble is I like it and I need a little more. (Chorus) Cocaine train, cocaine train. Can't afford to board this cocaine train. Cocaine train, cocaine train. Can't afford to lose it all again. Charlie keeps on taking every penny that I make. It doesn't feed the family, it doesn't reach the plate. I've never felt so wrong inside, I've never felt so right. This train is gonna hurt unless I'm following the light. (Chorus) Well I took to stealing like a duck takes to the ground Just to busy thinking 'bout the next train out of town. Forty nights of silence and they still won't let me go. Where's my worn out record of the Old Crow Medicine Show. (Chorus) Its taken all my money and its taken all my clothes. Its taken my whole family its all gone up my nose. Turns out this old rail road track has only one stop left. Just one piece of paper and it certifies my death. (Chorus) |          | FIDDLE            | Simon Rosellys   | 
      72 | Innocent                            | Innocent, but caught in the middle and I'm not quite sure where to go from here. Maybe South, far from the trouble and I'll take each day as it comes. The room was still, but full of your secrets and I'm tired of hearing that I'm all to blame. Where to now, far  from the trouble and I'll take each day as it comes. (Chorus) And all the words that you say to me, and all the good things that you can't quite see. Maybe someday you'll remember me, and take each day as it comes. Full of life, but somehow you stole it and you kept it all when you put me down. Went round and round, far from the sorrow and I'll take each day as it comes. (Chorus) x2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |          | FIDDLE            | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      73 | Empty Pockets                       | Got my hat, got my boots, ain't got nothing but a dollar to lose, and you see me walking, down fifth avenue. I got a whole lot of loving, without you. I like 'em short, like them tall. Like 'em big, like them small, and you see me talking, fifty dollars that's all. I got a whole lot of loving, without you. (Chorus) Empty pockets and I'm on my way home to you. Ain't got no money so I'm gonna have my wicked way with you.

      74 | Move A Little Bit                   | The same renditions, every week. The same people talking to me. Having trouble listening, and struggling to breathe. Always knew I was better than second best. Always wanted someone different from the rest. Someone to save me, from this lonely mess. (Chorus) Move a little bit over so I can see. This familiar stranger standing in front of me. Move a little bit closer to my destiny. Never knew it could happen so suddenly. Taking over my senses entirely. Everything is clear now, I'm ready to breathe. (Chorus) x2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      75 | Running Away                        | I'm running away with you by my side. I'm learning to breathe and be free, from the inside. I'm running way with you by my side. I'm keeping the World all around, on the outside. (Chorus) Does it feel real. Does it feel good. (Does it feel real). Does it feel right.

Walked in walked out, I'm scared you'll never find out. How wild I've been since I've been falling, in love.I feel your eyes, they're catching mine. I'll hold my breath, 'til you want me and no one else. (Chorus) The more I try, to make you mine. The harder I fall, 'cos you don't know me after all.

      77 | Wearing This Coat                   | I'm just a girl though I'm wearing this coat. People looking for a glimpse of some hope. Another story, another tragedy. Don't think your pain doesn't penetrate me. I'm just a girl though I wear my hair neat. I come to work, to help and to heal. Sometimes it happens, sometimes we fail, but don't think it's easy when it happens again. (Chorus) Sometimes we fail and I'm sorry. We all need closure but it's never that easy. I'm playing witness to the big things in life. Don't think it's easy and it's passing me by.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      78 | Walking Down The Aisle              | Walking down the aisle just me and you. Am I happy today, should I walk away. Got me thinking where you were last night, where were you? Got the look of her right in your eyes. Have you seen her today, did she ask you to stay. Got me thinking here you were last night, where were you? It might sound crazy but I'm not sure, you're even mine. Am I the only lady wasting my time on your lies?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      79 | Sorry but I'm English               | How's the weather out there, is it tipping it down. Did I just see the sun, No I blinked now its gone. (Chorus) I'm sorry, though I don't know what I've done. But saying it keeps me out of trouble, out of confrontation. No I don't know the Queen, prince Harry or the blonde one. I'm English and I'm sorry and I'm sorry but I'm English and I don't know what I've done. Would you like a cup of tea, may be two maybe three. Builders strong or luke warm, have a biscuit go on.

      80 | Don't Cry My Lover                  | Don't cry my lover, don't be afraid any more. Don't fight my lover, let your anger run cold, let your anger run cold. Don't lie my lover, I know you as well as myself. Don't die my lover, don't let the sadness take hold. (Don't let the sadness take hold). Picture us laying down underneath the warm sun. No one near, only you only me and our love.

      81 | Something Special                   | Nobody knows where the time goes. Ten years gone like the beat of a drum, but you had me before we'd even speak. (Chorus) You're something special to me x3 You're something special, don't you forget it. Caught up in the rat race, it's easy to miss the point of it all. To hold me when we fall asleep. (Chorus) Age is an illusion. You're only as old as you feel inside. I love you even more now. (Bridge) You make me who I want to be. A better person inside. (Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      82 | Don't Take My Voice                 | Don't say another word, keep your thoughts in. Don't sing another line, for an unknown amount of time. I'm not the one that can take the news, I'm not the one it should happen to. (Chorus) Don't take my voice x2 Don't drink another drink unless it's clean and it's pure. Don't stay up too late, with your friends in those bars I'm not the one that can take the news, I'm not the one it should happen to. (Chorus) Don't phone the ones you love when they're needing you most. Don't cry another tear for the music you've lost. I'm not the one that can take the news, I'm not the one it should happen to. (Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      83 | The River Wye                       | Summer time, the sun will shine and people come from all around. To see the River Wye to see the River Wye.    The weather's nice, we'll head on out, take our clothes off when the sun comes up. We'll swim the River Wye we'll swim the River Wye.       (Chorus)    It's on the border, of Wales and England, it'll carry you safe. Taking tourists, since the 1700's, it'll take you where you wanna go.     The autumn leaves of red and green, surround us as the summer's gone. The leaves are falling on the River Wye.    Winter's long, the frost will come, and sometimes it's cold enough, to freeze the River Wye to freeze the River Wye.   (Chorus)    (it'll take you away)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      85 | Our Miracle                         | I was just a girl and I would dream about our family and it would make me smile, had no reason to doubt my plans. But that was naïve, now I see. (Chorus) I've waited so long to write this song that I can sing to you. To heal the pain we've suffered every day since we've longed for you. You're our miracle, our miracle. Days turned to weeks and weeks turned into years. I couldn't believe, it was happening to me. But that was naïve, now I see. (Chorus) Felt like the whole World had something that we couldn't have and it was hard to bear, losing friends and losing sleep. But that was naïve, now I see. (Chorus) (Bridge) Now nothing compares to how I feel when I hear your heartbeat. (Chorus) I was just a girl and I would dream about our family, and now we have our girl.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      86 | It's Not Me It's You                | Was dancing with a man, a good friend of yours. You grabbed me by the arm, don't trust me any more. Was drinking hard all night. Would always end the same. We'd argue on the streets, then there'd be the tears. (Chorus) So take your things and go. I ain't got time for your games no more. It's not me it's you, and I'm done. I knew from the start, you'd never be the one. The way that you looked, the way you looked at me. I'd sing sometimes. You never thought me good. Tell me to be quiet, tell me that's enough.(Chorus) x2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      87 | Don't Let The Whiskey Win           | Life and soul, invisible, wash your troubles away. Morning comes the shaking starts, there's no getting away. (Chorus) Don't let the whiskey win, it's not worth the hurt it brings. Don't let the whiskey win Just one more before you hit the road, no one needs to know. 'Til you hit the breaks but it's just too late, laying cold on the floor. (Chorus) One more round it's your shout, credit card on the go. Come home late to an empty bed, she couldn't take any more. (Chorus) Repeat Don't let the whiskey win. (Don't let the whiskey win, don't let it win, don't let the whiskey win) (You're the life and the soul, no one needs to know)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      88 | Different Life                      | In a different life, in a different time. Maybe somehow you're still alive. In a different home, not unlike your own. In a different life, maybe you're not alone. You should have been loved, never alone. Always someone's hand to hold. In a different time, not unlike you've known. In a different life, maybe you're not alone. (Chorus) Now you're looking down, down on us from grace. Now you're looking down, the tears upon my face. Now you're looking down but no one sees you cry, when you're walking in the rain. (repeat verses and chorus) No one sees you cry x2 When you're walking in the rain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      89 | The Mess I Call Me                  | I try to remember all that I am. All I can see is not what I can. I try to remember the faces I've seen but all I can see is the mess I call me, the mess I call me. I try to remember the places I've been. A time before me, on you that I lean. I try to remember all that I was, but all I can see is the mess I call me, the mess I call me. I know how it feels to love and be loved, but the years that we've lost, to hurt and to pain. Now I struggle to hold on to all that I am. All I can see is the mess I call me, the mess I call me. I try to think of the days of before. A flicker of life, happy and more. I try to hold on to all that I was, but all I can see is the mess I call me, the mess I call me. Mess I call me (repeat)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      90 | Nothing Without You                 | I can take you on the ride of your life. I can make it with you by my side. I can take what's wrong and make it alright but I can't do nothing, without you, here by my side.   I can see the right in every wrong. I can feel the light when all hope is gone. I'll protect us when the trouble comes but I can't do nothing, without you, here by my side.

      91 | I'll Write You This Song            | Didn't know you would go so soon, if I did I'd have made the last drive. Didn't know you would go so soon, can't believe it's the end of your life. (Chorus) But you know how I care. You know 'cos I was always there. Now it's time, 'cos you have gone, I'll write you this song. I'll write you this song. Didn't know you would go like this, thought I'd see you one last time. Didn't know you would go like this, doesn't feel like I've said my goodbyes.

      92 | All That I Want                     | You're everything all that I want. You know that I love you, you know that I care. There we go, here we are. You're everything all that I want. Sometimes I'm all that you're not. I know that you love me, I know that you care. There you go, here we are. (Chorus) You're everything all that I want. You're everything all that I need. Everything all I can be. Everything all that I want.

      93 | Loud And Clear                      | A nine hour drive to play forty five minutes. The money we make doesn't cover the run. Leave our families behind for a life on the road. We're missing the details the emails won't know. (Chorus) Listen loud and clear. It's not easy standing here,  singing our souls, for you to judge. For over ten years we've worked on these songs. How long did it take you to shrug them all off. Did you think it through when you wrote down those words. No second thought, the damage was done. (Chorus) Gave up our jobs security gone, 'cos we love our guitars and to play to someone. The age we are now should have settled down. But playing is us and we won't give it up.

      94 | This Old House                      | This old house in our town. Years gone by, stories etched in stone.

      95 | Behind Me                           | I hear the closing of the door. I feel the silence all around me. I thought I'd learnt this long before. The way to say goodbye, I'll put it all behind me. And when you left me standing here. You had the last unspoken word. And now we've shed our final tear. The way you made me cry, I'll put it all behind me. (Chorus) And have you listened to a word that I've said. My thoughts are clear now we have come to an end. No second chances are coming your way. And I'll put it all behind me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys |

All around, fades to one, say the wrong thing and I'm done. (Chorus) Legs feels weak, can barely stand, feel the touch of your hand. All around, fades to one, say the wrong thing and I'm done.

Nothing else matters, 'cos my baby's not there. (Chorus) I woke up this morning with you in my bed. The weekdays behind me, we got the weekend ahead.

      98 | Lost And Found                      | I used to live without those feelings inside. I used to live without those warm winter nights. No one who knew me and made it feel right. And then I met you, one day last spring. As if I knew by heart, the passion you'd bring. Your presence calmed my soul and let me sing. (Chorus) Waking every morning with a smile on my face, nothing can bring me down. Knowing that you're near me with a healing kiss, I was lost and found. You make me dizzy like I can't explain. Those music moments we just can't contain. Kissing my body, 'til I go insane. Someone to talk to when it's getting late. Someone who listens not there to dictate. To save a broken soul and banish all hate. (Chorus) (Bridge) It's our music revolution, our revolution, love and intuition. Music revolution, a revolution, join the band of lost and found.(Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
      99 | Favourite Last Mistake              | How many girls have you tried, to use as shoulders to cry on. How many days will it take, 'til you remember my name. (Chorus) Don't make me a game you'll play. Don't make me a favourite last mistake. I'll leave on the last train out of town. Too many memories to face, they come and go all the time now. Too many faces to hate, it's just a matter of time now. (Chorus 2) You've made me a game you've played. You've made me your favourite last mistake. I'm leaving I'm riding out this time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys | 
     100 | Old Man                             | I ain't feeling like an old man. I ain't feeling like an old man. Bit I've been around a little bit longer and its all been good. I ain't feeling like an old man. I ain't feeling like an old man. But the years have been a calling and my body listened more than my mind. (Chorus) And just like the day I came in, somebody was heading on out. It's just the way that its always been, one in one out, one in one out, one in. But I ain't feeling like an old man. I ain't feeling like an old man. I ain't feeling like an old man. 'Cos I'm as old as my tongue and a little bit older than my teeth. I ain't feeling like I haven't won. I ain't feeling like I haven't won. 'Cos I'm leaving with a smile of the thought of my next  randson. (Chorus)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |          |                   | Rebecca Rosellys |
